    1. Which lifecycle method is used to clear the DOM when a component is deleted from the DOM?
    Answer: In class components, it's componentWillUnmount(). In functional components, it's achieved with useEffect().

    2. What is the difference between state and props?
    Answer:
    
    Props:
    Data is passed from a parent component to a child component.
    Data cannot be modified by the child component.
    It is controlled by the parent component.
    State:
    Data of the component can be updated locally.
    Data can be updated using the setState() method.
    It is controlled by the component in which it is declared.

    3. Explain about Router.
    Answer:
    
    Router is a third-party library that can be installed using npm install react-router-dom.
    It is used in a single-page application with multiple views.
    It is used to navigate from one page to another.
    It maps specific components to different URLs, enabling the rendering of distinct UIs for each route.

    4. Explain Context Flow.
    Answer:
    
    Note : install router to use Router, npm install react-router-dom.
    First we have to create a folder , inside src->component->sample->context->context.js, reducer.js
    Another folder inside sample->Router ->Home.js,Service.js.
    In Home.js and Service.js , create a functional component.
    Outside src , create routing.js and link Home.js & Service.js in routing.js
    Create a context using createContext().
    Declare initial state and an update function in a separate reducer file.
    Eg : export const initialstate = //initial state
    
    {name : "sanjeev"}
    
    //update function
    
    export const Reducer = (state,action)=>{
    
    //update function if give 2, =>state and action}
    
    In a component, declare a state using useReducer() hook, and import context, initial state, and the update function.
    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(Reducer,initialstate)
    we have to import context from context.js and initial state and update function from Reducer.js
    import { globalstate } from './Component/globalstate/context/Context' // context
    
    import { initialstate,Reducer } from './Component/globalstate/context/Reducer' // initial state and update function from Reducer.js
    
    Wrap the component with the Provider from the context, providing the state and dispatch.
    Read the state using useContext() hook in the components.
